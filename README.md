# Polymorphic Keylogger

This repository contains a Python keylogger script that incorporates polymorphic strategies to evade detection by security systems. The keylogger captures keystrokes and encrypts them using dynamically generated keys, while also obfuscating its own code to avoid detection.

## Features

- Captures keystrokes on the target system.
- Implements polymorphic techniques to dynamically change its behavior and structure.
- Encrypts the captured keystrokes using a randomly generated key.
- Obfuscates the keylogger code to evade detection.
- Stores the encrypted keystrokes for later analysis.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- [External dependency, if any]

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/tukru/basic_polymorphic_keylogger
    
    Navigate to the repository directory:

    shell

cd polymorphic-keylogger

Install the required dependencies, if any:

shell

pip install -r requirements.txt

Customize the keylogger settings and polymorphic strategies in the code according to your requirements.

Run the keylogger script:

shell

    python keylogger.py

    The keylogger will start capturing keystrokes and storing them securely.
